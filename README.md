# Foreman-Worker Communication Mockup

A web-based mockup showcasing a real-time communication system between a foreman's dashboard and a worker's device. This interactive demonstration illustrates how messages can be sent from a control center to field workers with predefined templates and quick response options.

## 🚀 Features

### Foreman Dashboard
- **Message Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common scenarios (Safety alerts, Break time, Meetings, Task assignments, Emergency protocols)
- **Character Limit**: 140-character message limit with real-time counter
- **Custom Response Buttons**: Up to 3 configurable quick response buttons per message
- **Message History**: Track all sent messages and received responses with timestamps
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant confirmation when worker responds

### Worker Device Simulation
- **Realistic Device Interface**: Mobile device-like screen with limited space
- **Message Display**: Clear message presentation optimized for small screens
- **Quick Response Buttons**: Easy-to-tap response options
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for message reception and response sending
- **Signal Strength Indicator**: Simulated connectivity status

## 🎯 Use Cases

This mockup demonstrates communication scenarios such as:
- **Safety Alerts**: Critical safety information with acknowledgment requirements
- **Break Notifications**: Scheduled break announcements with timing confirmations
- **Meeting Reminders**: Event notifications with attendance confirmations
- **Task Assignments**: Work order distribution with acceptance/rejection options
- **Emergency Protocols**: Urgent communications requiring immediate response

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Built With
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox, Grid, and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks - pure JavaScript for all functionality

### Key Components
- Split-screen responsive layout
- Real-time message synchronization
- Local message history storage
- Interactive form validation
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server setup required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start sending messages from the foreman dashboard!

### Usage
1. **Select a Template**: Choose from predefined message templates or create custom messages
2. **Customize Message**: Edit the message text (140 character limit)
3. **Configure Responses**: Set up quick response buttons for the worker
4. **Send Message**: Click "Send Message" to deliver to the worker device
5. **Worker Response**: Click response buttons on the device simulation
6. **View History**: Check the message history for all interactions

## 🎮 Interactive Controls

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + Enter`: Send message from foreman dashboard
- `Escape`: Clear device screen (demo mode)

### Demo Functions
- **Auto-Response Simulation**: Use `simulateWorkerResponse()` in browser console for automatic testing

## 📱 Responsive Design

The mockup adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full split-screen layout
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with full functionality
- **Mobile**: Single column layout optimized for touch interaction

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Elements
- **Modern Gradient Background**: Professional purple-blue gradient
- **Device Frame**: Realistic mobile device simulation
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and button feedback
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status messages
- **Notification System**: Slide-in confirmations for responses

### Color Coding
- **Blue (#007bff)**: Primary actions and information
- **Green (#28a745)**: Success states and confirmations
- **Yellow (#ffc107)**: Warnings and pending states
- **Red (#dc3545)**: Alerts and character limit warnings

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential features for expanded versions:
- Multiple worker device support
- Message encryption simulation
- Offline message queuing
- Analytics dashboard
- Custom template creation
- Audio/vibration alerts
- File attachment support
